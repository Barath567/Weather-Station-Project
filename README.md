**Weather-Station-Project**

We introduced a small device using Arduino module to monitor the environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and air pressure and updated the collected data (weather statistics) to the cloud storage. 
We were planning to implement this system through having the device as a small box and able to monitor the weather all over Sri Lanka. 
Here, I worked on air quality monitoring â€“ embedded system using MQ135 module & IOT (ThingSpeak) analytics and wind speed monitoring using vertical axis wind turbine and IR speed sensing module.
